                <p> For the design sprint we had to go through a long <em>process</em> in order to reach the final long term goal which was making another <b>version of fronter</b> which would be fully costumizable by the users. First we had to do our map with our long term goal, then we had to individually sketch our ideas , After we had to decide which ideas we should take from our sketches.<br><br> Moreover, we had to start building an <b>XD prototype</b> with adobe XD and the final step was testing our prototype with different users and writting down notes. We got a taste of how it is when you work as a professional UX designer in groups. and how important it is to <em>sketch your ideas first </em>before you decide to build a prototype. </p>

                <p> This week we had to code a <b>functional digital solution</b> (HTML/CSS prototype) based on the XD
                    prototype we produced last week. We basically had to use html,css and also javascript to <em> bring the xd prototype to life.</em> </p>

                <p> So far, we had worked on developing a mobile solution of an improved Fronter implementing
                    <em>KEA’s goals and feature wishes</em>. Later the teachers gave us full freedom to create whatever we thought would be the best app for kea's students. We went through a the same process again <b>(map,sketch,decide, prototype,pitch)</b> which gave us more knowledge about <b>making decisions up front and making sketching before we move on</b> etc. <br><br>We were given a few requirements like our native app has to be native for either an <em>Android or iOS smartphone</em>, our group size must be from 3 to 7 and we had to make them ourselves and we had to Make use of UI kits and implement them where needed in our native app prototype.<br><br> This theme was one of the best for groupworking, It said a lot about how <em>challenging things can be when you work as a group</em> because the other group members might not like the ideas you wanted to implement, so you have to take a step back and "take one for the team".

                <p> At the end of the week we had <b>to Document and communicate the UX design solutions</b>, like a professional.
                    we had <b>continuously, collected materials </b>in a document (Google Doc) where we also have added descriptions, annotations and reflections on our work and the process. <br><br>Similar to a log. This document would become our theme documentation. We had to go back and refine everything and finish the theme documentation. We gain a lot of<em> knowledge </em>on how to collect and apply empirical data about users and situations of use etc.
