                <p> In my opinion, This theme was really important because we learned things about <b>videography and about planing our work ahead</b> of time in adobe XD. At first I thought <b>adobe XD</b> wasnt so useful, but after using it, I realised how important and time saving it is if you plan your work ahead. Using adobe XD was easy,it had <b>easy to learn tools</b> and it was simple, I didnt face many difficulties because since its made by adobe i already knew how to use it because its very <b>similar to other Adobe products.</b>On this specific Project we as a team, made this prototype in order to know how our website that we would build in the following weeks, would look like, It helped us with <b>deciding beforehand</b> about the design and <b>layout</b> of the website. </p>

                <p>This project was done in a <b>group of 4 people</b>, We all had different positions and assignments to do, We had to <b>shoot a video </b>but it hadto be a video <b>communicating a message without words!</b> At first we faced some<b> difficulties </b>with finding a good camera to shoot it and deciding who would be the actors.we <b>gained a lot of knowledge</b> of basic principles for the composition and layout of digital <b>media productions</b>
                    and In the end we all learned how to <b>edit a basic video</b> and how to research about the things we had to implement in the video.</p>

                <p>On this project we learned how to <b>make a treatment</b>, Which is basically writing down all the <b>scenes before you shoot them</b>. We understood that it is very important to write down the script first and then to act.By doing this we saved ourselves from getting stuck and not knowing what to do. Also the treatment helped everyone in our team to be in the <b>same page </b>and understand what we have to do. We had no difficulties with the treatment </p>

                <p> The storyboard was a <b>continuation</b> of the same project as above, We had to <b>draw the scenes</b> and add as many details as we could, Not only this helped us to <b>understand</b> what we were going to shoot bettter, But it helped other people outside of our group to immediately know what the scenes are about. The only difficulty we faced was that we all were <b> terrible at drawing.</b> </p>

                <p> After we shot the video,We had to make a <b>website prototype </b>to host that video and to write a few things about us. We were split into designers and coders, I <b>had the coding part </b>of the website which I enjoyed doing, I also helped a lot with the design of the website and I choose my favorite color of background which is black. I also choose the name of the group and the logo as well. We worked well together to code the website and then add a nice design on it. The only <b>difficulty we faced was with coding</b>. Since we were 2 coders we had to split the work and it was a bit <b>difficult to cordinate</b> when there are 2 people coding.</p>

                <p> After all the hard work everyone had done, We finished the website. The website was about <b>Biking in Copenhagen </b>the benefits and the risks of it. It also included a <em>video </em>that we shot ourselves. We had some <em>difficulties</em> with getting on the same page and not everyone could meet as planned due to work or other personal stuff. We all <b>Aquired new skills </b>in the Media production field, Technology field and we all learned new things about making a good presentation in front of others. To make the website we used some javascript, html and css. the website was handcoded and done by<em> 2 coders</em>. We also had 4 designers. The video was shot on an Iphone and was editted with <b>Adobe premier</b>.
