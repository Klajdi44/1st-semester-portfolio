                <p> This Theme was one of the most important ones. <b>We learned a lot about animations</b> which I implemented them in this specific project. In my opinion it was really <em>easy</em> to make this project because making animations is not hard since it requires a few lines of code only. I made some buttons and made them start an animation when clicked. After I was done with the project I started <b>implementing different animations</b> on my future websites which raised the user experience bar very high. </p>

We also had to write down the different scenes that we had to make as well as drawings.  It was very fun to make it nontheless. <b>I got a chance to  improve a little bit my drawing skills</b> and work with Adobe illustrator </p>

                <p>This particular project was one of my <em>favorites </em> for the 1st semester. This was the first time I worked with a little bit <b>more advanced javascript </b>which I totally loved. I handcoded everything on my own, I learned a lot about <em>css positioning</em> as well as <b>functions that call one another in javascript</b>. I spent a lot of hours mostly trying to fix the different bugs that were appearing out of nowhere in javascript. <b>Javascript is really case sensitive </b>so I had to be very careful and go through all the code to find the errors that were not allowing my animations to work. It took me a long time to solve the errors but it was worth it once I saw what I had created out of scratch. I learned a bit more advanced functions in javascript. </p>

                <p>This particular project was one of my <em>favorites too</em> for the 1st semester. This was the first time <b>I created a game from scratch.</b> It was very fun to see what javascript can do and how easy it actoually was in the end. The most difficult thing was again the <b>javascrip case sensitivity</b>. We used a <em>random generated math number</em> for javascript in order to create the game, The random math number was giving the moving part random locations and the user had to <b>click in order to "kill the bee"</b>. At the end of the day I got to learn how to make a game and brag to my friends about it. </p>

                <p>The task we chose for project day 2 was to make a <b>calculator using Javascript</b>. One difficulty we faced was making the calculator to work. We were having a <b>weird a error </b>and the calculator was giving back wrong numbers. After finishing it, we got a little bit more knowledge on how javascript works and the logic behind it. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="page-right">
                <p>On this task we learned how to make a <em>personas collage</em>, The collage had to be done based on one person. Our <b>targeted audience</b> were young adults. The collage consists of everything that our young adult likes, For example the food he likes , what he wears , what music he likes and what kind of OS he perefers. This was very useful to make becauase we could make our <em>final interactive animation </em>based on the collage. We had to remake the collage a few times because we did not fully understand that we have to make the collage around the targeted audience. We used photoshop to create the collage. </p>

                <p>This was the final <b>project for theme 03</b>. We had to for a group of <em>coders and designers</em>, we were 7 persons in total. I was one of the coders and we had 5 designers. My responsibility was to take care of what happens on the <b>back with coding</b>. I learned a lot of new things about javascript, a lot of things about how groupwork works and how to cordinate with eachother and give tasks to everyone in the group. Since we were 7 people in the group it was a bit <b>hard to be on the same page</b> with everyone and there were a lot of times that some members of the group did not know what they were supposed to do or what the other team members where doing.</p>

                <p>For this project we had to do a <em>sceen cast documentation</em>, we had to describe who we are what were our roles in the group and what was our theme. It was really fun to make and put together with <em>Adobe Premier</em>. We got to learn a little bit more about <b>video editting</b> while doing this project. We did not face any difficulties.</p>
