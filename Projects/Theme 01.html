                <p> This was one of the first projects that we did in class for the <b>1st semester</b>. It was pretty fun to do. Personally,I learned how to use <b>photoshop</b> in somewhat advanced levels.<br><br> I had troubles at first to learn the tools i needed to make the moodboard because photoshop can be very difficult for begginers because it has so many settings and tools.<br><br> With a little bit of practise i was able to learn how to make a moodboard and learn something about design and different styles as well.<br><br>Nevertheless i had to make the moodboard <b>at least 5 times</b> before i nailed it, everytime i created a new one i was learning from the mistakes i did in the last one. </p>

                <p> On this project we had to create a<b> mobile first website</b>. It was my first time creating anything with <b> html and css</b>.We got a specific style and we had to make a page describing the specific features of that style. <br><br>It was hard for almost everyone who wasn't experienced with html and ccs.I faced a lot of difficulties when i was coding my website, mainly because i was not familiar with the syntax of html and css. <br><br>After watching a few videos and asking the teachers i became comfortable enough to build my own website. When i finished it i had gained enough knowledge to build a very <b>basic mobile first website</b> </p>

                <p> A few weeks after we were done with the basic<b> website above</b>, We had to do go back on the basic website we made but make it <b>Responsive</b>. To do that we learned about the <b>media queries</b> and how they can make an unrisponsive website to a nice looking responsive one.We also learned about <b>css grid</b> and how useful and time saving it is.<br><br>Personally i faced a lot of difficulties to understand how css grid works, It was confusing at first but became easier and easier everytime i was playing around with it in order to get how it works. After i understood how it worked i was able to build a responsive webiste! </p>
